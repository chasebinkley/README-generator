# README-generator

## Overview

​
Our 9th week challenge.

### The challenge

​
I was tasked with creating a README generator so that a user can quickly create a professional README for a new project. The README is created when the user follows the command line and inputs their title of their project, a description, a table of contents, installation instructions, type of usage, license, contributions, tests, and contact info for questions.
